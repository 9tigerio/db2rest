# General
We use [semantic versioning](https://semver.org).

We publish our snapshots on [GitHub Packages](https://github.com/orgs/9tigerio/packages?repo_name=db2rest).

We publish our releases on [Maven Central Portal](https://central.sonatype.com/) (Sonatype) under our namespace [io.9tiger](https://central.sonatype.com/namespace/io.9tiger)

We publish a **snapshot** `-SNAPSHOT` version at any time by using the corresponding GitHub Action.

We publish a **release** version to [Maven Central Portal](https://central.sonatype.com/namespace/io.9tiger) at any time by using the corresponding GitHub Action.

After a release, we can also build and publish a Docker container image to our DockerHub (working account for now: [kdhrubo](https://hub.docker.com/r/kdhrubo/db2rest)) via the corresponding GitHub Action.
