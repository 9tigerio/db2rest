DB2Rest is an **open-source DATA API platform** that provides REST API over databases in seconds.
It takes care of all the boilerplate data access logic and best practices, thus freeing up development team to focus on building 
complex business logic and intuitive user interfaces. :airplane:

DB2Rest simplifies development of data-intensive intelligent applications. :bulb:
It connects (traditional and ML enabled)databases and AI services(OPENAI, AWS Bedrock) to provide Web APIs to load AI models, ingest data, perform database queries with natural language, and quickly share insights and data with other applications.

# Use Cases 

## Faster Innovation with Instant AI API Gateway

DB2Rest provides instant REST API over AI-powered databases.  This allows AI traffic control, governance, observability, natural language queries, rapid provisioning of ML models, data sanitization, and exchange of insights and data.

## Application Delivery Accelerator
DB2Rest provides instant REST API(no code generation) to boost development by 30x. Low code and best practices are built-in. Engineers can focus on complex business rules and user interface development.  

## Simplify Integration
DB2Rest works as a secure database gateway to open up databases to internal developers and partners paving the way to build new applications and innovative solution.

Complex, insecure and maintenance-heavy file-based data exchange can be replaced with DB2Rest. Applications can be loosely coupled by reducing direct database based integration.


## Easy Database DevOps and Documentation
Evolve database structures at speed with DB2Rest DML support. DB2Rest provides database visualization, diagramming, linting and diff.
