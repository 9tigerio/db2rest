DB2Rest is an **open-source REST DATA API platform** to rapidly build data access layer with minimal engineering effort. 
DB2Rest connects with **modern AI powered database or traditional database** to instantly provide API to 
perform different data access and manipulation operations, 
, load Machine Learning(ML) models, export and share data and insights.  

It has all the best practices built-in, so that developers can focus on business logic, build intuitive user-interface and build intelligent applications
powered by artificial intelligence(AI).
