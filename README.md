DB2Rest is a modern low code REST DATA API platform that makes it easy to build intelligent applications 30x faster. 
It combines existing/new databases and data-sources with language models (LM/LLMs) and vector stores to rapidly 
deliver context-aware, reasoning applications without any vendor lock-in. :bulb:

# Use Cases 

## Accelerate Application Delivery with Instant REST DATA API

DB2Rest provides instant REST API(no code generation) to boost development by 30x. Low code and best practices are built-in saving engineering teams
months of effort and cost. 

## Faster innovation with Gen AI

DB2Rest works hand in glove with modern vector databases and LLM implementations to provide consistent Web APIs to deliver smart applications.

## Secure Database Gateway

DB2Rest works as a secure database gateway. This helps enterprises to open up data to internal developers and partners in a safe and agile way which was not possible earlier.

## Simplify Integration

Complex, error-prone maintenance-heavy file-based data exchange can be replaced with DB2Rest. Integrations can be loosely coupled by reducing direct database based integration.


## Easy Database DevOps and Documentation

Evolve database structures at speed with DB2Rest DML support. DB2Rest provides database visualization, diagramming, linting and diff.
