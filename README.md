DB2Rest is an **open-source API platform** to rapidly build data access layer with minimal engineering effort. 
DB2Rest connects with your database to instantly provide REST API to perform data access operations(create, read, insert, update) 
and execute stored functions/procedures. 
It takes care of all data access logic and best practices, so that developers can focus on solving complex business logic or building small user-interface components. 
Thus, DB2Rest can provide significant boost to your application delivery and save engineering cost. 

DB2Rest can also act as a secure gateway for legacy databases. This can replace cumbersome, expensive file based data sharing and shared database based integration.
The capability to expose existing data to partners and internal developers securely at scale opens up possibilities of innovation and digital transformation.
